# Surfs Up Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis to find information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, to find temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources
- [x] Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, SQLlite, Notepad++

## Results ##

The results of this analysis are stated below:
- [x] In Month of June the average temperature is 75 degrees ,the maximum temperature goes as high as 85 degrees and minimum temperature goes below to 64 degrees.

## Summary
Overall because the results are temperature focused a lot more analysis should be done on the weather to determine if the shop should be open year around. Based solely on the average temperature between June and December the weather stays rather steady in the 70â€™s, which is great for a surf and ice cream shop. More analysis should be done on the other months of the year and not just June and December and a query that looks at temperatures year around should be done. Another query should also be performed that looks into other weather factors such as precipitation, tropical storm patterns, and surf swell given the nature of the business we are assisting.
