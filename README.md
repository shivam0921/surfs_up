# Surfs Up Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to review temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, HI, in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Specially by looking at the temperatures during th months of June and December.

## Resources
- [x] Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, SQLlite, Notepad++
- [x] Data Source [here](https://github.com/shivam0921/surfs_up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite?raw=true)

## Results ##

The results of this analysis showed the following:
  * The average temperature in June is ~75 degrees and in December is ~71 degrees. On a hole this isn not a large difference
  * The maximum temperature in June in the data set was ~85 degrees while in December it was ~83 degrees
  * THe minimum recorded temperature in June was ~64 degrees while in December it was a chilly ~56 degrees

## Summary
Overall because the results are temperature focused a lot more analysis should be done on the weather to determine if the shop should be open year around. Based solely on the average temperature between June and December the weather stays rather steady in the 70â€™s, which is great for a surf and ice cream shop. More analysis should be done on the other months of the year and not just June and December and a query that looks at temperatures year around should be done. Another query should also be performed that looks into other weather factors such as precipitation, tropical storm patterns, and surf swell given the nature of the business we are assisting.
