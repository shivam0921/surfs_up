## Summary
The challenges helps us to draw the pattern of the series over the course of six month weather analysis from the start of month of June and to end of month of December.
From this analysis we can find out how the temp will be over the period and its is a good idea to open the surf shop and ice cream shop or not. Looking at the analysis its totally
makes sense to open the shop and run the business.
The more deep analysis should be done on different aspects like customer base , traffic on the days and all the months should be consdiered will dooing the analysis.
